# **Guide: How Architecture Students Should Survey Existing Spaces and Houses**

Surveying existing spaces is a core skill in architecture. You’ll encounter many situations where you must accurately measure rooms, building components, and complex spaces. A well‑planned survey saves time, money, and return visits, especially when access to the site is restricted.

## **Tools You’ll Need**

**Basic Tools**
- A notebook (A5 works well)
- _Alternative:_ A clipboard that holds A4 sheets
- Graph paper (helpful for drawing plans quickly)
- Black and red pens (fine‑liners or Bic)
- Laser measurer
- Small measuring tape (1.5 m recommended)
- Camera (your phone is perfect)

**Advanced / Helpful Tools**
- Low‑tack masking tape
- Thick marker (black and red)
- Levelling staff
- Calliper for small details
- Solid dark flat board (for laser targeting in difficult conditions)

**Tip:** Good hand‑drawing skills speed up and improve your survey process.

# **Planning Before the Visit**

1. **Gather Existing Information**  
    - Check if you have existing plans, photos, or documents. Even basic sketches help you pre‑visualize the space.
    
2. **Expect Two Visits**
    - **Visit 1:** Quick overall assessment, general dimensions, lots of photos, identify areas that need detailed measurement.
    - **Visit 2:** Return to collect missing or complex data.
    
3. **Determine Your Required Level of Detail**  
    - Think ahead. Even if you don’t need all details now, collecting a bit more ensures future flexibility.
    
4. **Prepare Your Drawing Set**  
    If you have a base plan:
    - Print it.
    - With a **red pen**, mark every dimension you must verify on‑site.
    
5. **Create a Checklist of Elements to Verify** Examples:
    - Window types & materials
    - Wall and floor materials
    - Corner angles
    - Built‑in furniture
    - Ceiling features, beams, radiators, etc.
    - Structure
    
6. **If You Don’t Have Existing Plans**  
    Prepare to draw the base plans and sections yourself on site.

# **On-Site Survey Workflow**

### **1. Draw the Basic Plan (If None Exists)**

Use graph paper if freehand is challenging.  
Sketch:

- Room shapes
- Doors
- Windows
- Fixed furniture
- Odd corners or recesses

**Do NOT measure yet.**

### **2. Mark What Needs to Be Measured**

With a **red pen**, trace all dimensions you need to collect.

### **3. Begin Measuring Systematically**

Room by room:

- Start with **overall dimensions**
- Move to smaller details and corners
- Use the tape for small elements

### **4. Use Smart Measuring Techniques**

For example:

- Diagonal measurements help fix oblique or irregular rooms
- Triangulation helps confirm inconsistent walls

### **5. Measure Wall Thicknesses**

Also check:

- Door frames
- Architraves
- Window recess depths

### **6. Measure Vertical Information**

- Ceiling heights
- Step heights (first, middle, last)
- Floor‑to‑floor heights
- Compare with ceiling height to estimate slab thickness

### **7. Draw Small Diagrams**

Sections, elevations, or detail sketches where needed.  
Add dimensions directly next to each sketch.

### **8. Laser Tips**

- Bright sunlight can affect readings
- Use a dark board or notebook as a target surface

### **9. Photograph Systematically**

After measuring, photograph every room **in order**:

- General views
- Wall‑perpendicular shots (for later orthogonal tracing)
- Detail photos (kept as orthogonal as possible)

### **10. Label Elements Using Masking Tape**

Helps with later identification.  
Use **low‑tack tape** to avoid damaging surfaces.

# **Back in the Studio**

1. **Clean Up Your Survey Immediately**  
    Fix typos, clarify unclear notes, and store your raw survey safely.
    
2. **Start Drafting in AutoCAD or Revit**  
    Begin with general room sizes, then align adjoining spaces.
    
3. **Identify Missing Dimensions**  
    It's normal to have gaps.  
    Make educated guesses but **mark them as approximations**.
    
4. **Re‑Print Plans with Accurate Geometry**  
    Use these cleaned plans to clearly trace missing or unclear dimensions.
    
5. **Return to Site (If Needed)**  
    Repeat quickly with your refined checklist until your plans are accurate.

# **Pro Tips**

- Use **black** for drawings, **red** for measurements.  
    Add **blue or green** for additional layers of information if it helps you.
    
- **Always start with big dimensions first.**  
    They anchor your drawing so smaller details fit correctly.
    
- **Work in a consistent direction** (clockwise or counter‑clockwise around each room).
    
- **Take more photos than you think you need.**  
    You’ll thank yourself later.

# **Practice Exercise**

Survey your own home first.  
Why?

- You already have strong spatial awareness of it
- You'll learn how sizes “feel” (e.g., what 6 m actually means in real space)
- Helps you understand practical room sizes when designing projects
- It’s a low‑pressure environment to build confidence

You will come across countless situations where you will need to measure spaces on site. The tools you need 

Tools needed:
- A notebook (A5 is good)
- Alternative: A clipboard that can hold an A4
- Graph paper instead of plain paper can be helpful.
- A black pen and a red pen (Thin; I usually use fine liner or Bic)
- A measuring laser
- A measuring tape for tiny (I use a small pocket 1,5m)
- Optional: Caliper (to measure very tiny details)
- Camera (phone)

Advanced:
- Low tack masking tape
- Thick Marker (Black and Red)
- Levelling staff
- solid piece of dark material

Generally nice to have good hand drawings skills.

Visiting the site takes time, costs money, and it is not always accessible (it might be dependent on someone else responsible), so plan it very well beforehand so you avoid having to go on site unnecessarily. By planning it well you can survey most data you need to create accurate plans, sections, elevations etc.

Planning
1. Do you have any existing plans, photos or information that you can have a look and feel the space before visiting the site? 
2. Generally takes 2 times to get most dimensions needed. The first visit should be quick, take an overall view of the space, take lots of photos, take general dimensions, look for repeating patterns, identify what needs to be surveyed. Takes lots of notes (see further)
3. What level of detail will you need to make an accurate representation for your needs? Remember, takes always a little more data than you need, you might always need it in the future, makes life easier.
4. If you already have a plan of the site, perfect, print it. Now with a fine red pen, plan the measurements that you must do on your visit. Trace the dimensions that you need. 
5. Write a list of elements that have to be checked, like window types, wall material, floor material, other materials used, odd corners, existing furniture, etc.
6. If you don't have any existing plans, you will have to draw them on-site (see further).

On-site
1. If you don't have any printed plans, now is the time to draw them yourself on-site. Use graph paper if you have difficulty drawing freehand. If you already had printed plans with the traced dimensions, then skip to step 3.
2. Start with the main entrance, and roughly draw the shape of the rooms. It doesn't have to be perfectly proportionate. Show where the windows and doors are, any corners, and any relevant fixed furniture. Don't take any measurements now!
3. After you have a rough plan of the site, trace (with a red pen), the dimensions that you need to take. Now go around the site, room by room, and take those measurements with the laser, jot them down in the plan you just drawn. If you must, use the tape as well. Start with general dimensions then go into more detail and corners.
4. Remember that you can use clever measurements to get other difficult measurements. For example with oblique rooms (more on that further.
5. Don't forget to take measure the width of the walls, and it's very useful to also measure the architrave and door frames.
6. Take measure of the ceiling height and any steps. Put them down in your drawing.
7. Draw lots of little diagrams of sections, details, elevations, and put more measurements there.
8. To measure steps, measure the first and last step, and one in the middle. Some times the first step has a slight difference to the rest of the steps. Add them all up to get a floor to floor height. Compare with the ceiling height to determine the slab/floor width.
9. On very sunny days, the laser might not work well
10. Bring a solid piece of flat dark wood (a notebook works as well), to serve as a base to point the laser to and take hard to reach measurements (see diagram).
11. Once you have the measurements, start photographing all rooms and areas of the site, in order (it helps a lot later). Take general photos of the spaces, and then take the photos as straight as possible, perpendicular to the walls and floor. Take photos of details, also, as orthogonal as possible, you might have to trace these details over in Autocad, and it will be useful to determine their dimensions as well (more on that further).
12. A pro tip: Use masking tape and marker to label rooms, windows, furniture etc, when you take the photos, it will be easier to identify these elements. Be careful with the tape on sensitive surfaces, not to damage them. Use low tack masking tape to be easily removable, and leave no marks.

Back in the studio
1. Once your back at home or studio, you must clean up your survey. While your memory is still fresh, fix any typos or illegible measurements. Always keep these original raw survey, take a picture of it so you don't lose it.
2. Go on Autocad or Revit. Start drafting the space using the dimensions you took. Easier to start with general dimensions of the room, and then aligning the rooms (my personal preference).
3. You will most probably find out that you forgot to take some dimensions, that's normal. Make an educated guess, but note these down. Print the plans and sections again, this time the layout will have accurate proportions and dimensions.
4. Trace again, all measurements that were forgotten, or that need more detail.
5. Go back on site, and repeat the process until you have an accurate survey that you need.


Pro tips:
- 




Red for dimensions, black for drawing details. Optionally you can take a blue or green pen to add more different information, up to you.

Exercise:
Start with your own home. Why? you live there and you probably have a good spatial awareness of the house. If your room is 4m by 6m, then you will have a stronger idea of what 6m feels like. When you draw your own projects, you will have a good reference in your mind. Suppose your room is tiny, and not fit for a good bed, then you will know that once you start designing your projects, you might need bigger dimensions for a room to fit a bed.
